# Introduction

Emojis or avatars are ways to indicate nonverbal cues. These cues have become an essential part of online chatting, product review, brand emotion, and many more. It also lead to increasing data science research dedicated to emoji-driven storytelling.

With advancements in computer vision and deep learning, it is now possible to detect human emotions from images. In this deep learning project, we will classify human facial expressions to filter and map corresponding emojis or avatars.

# Problem statement

We build a deep learning model to classify facial expressions from the images. Then we will map the classified emotion to an emoji or an avatar.


# About the Dataset

The FER2013 dataset ( facial expression recognition) consists of 48*48 pixel grayscale face images. The images are centered and occupy an equal amount of space. This dataset consist of facial emotions of following categories:

0:angry

1:disgust

2:fear

3:happy

4:sad

5:surprise

6:natural

# TOOLS AND LIBRARIES

. Python – 3.x

. Numpy – 1.19.2

. Pandas – 1.2.4

. TensorFlow – 2.4.x

. Emoji – 1.2.0

To install the above modules, run the following command:

pip install numpy pandas tensorflow emoji

# INSTALLATION

To run this code in your local system you have to download this repository using- Git clone

https://github.com/sreelakshmicv/Emoji-creation-using-live-facial-expressions.

Now open the required directories and install python packages required for run the code.Then run the code.

# TRAINING AND EVALUATION

I have used my local system to run this model.

LAPTOP-FOH9E19Q

Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-7020U CPU @ 2.30GHz 2.30 GHz

#FURTHER MODIFICATION

In future you can modify the user interface by creating emojis for both the real time facial emotions as well as the Video/Photo which is already recorded(By uploading those video/photo in the ui and convert to emojis).
